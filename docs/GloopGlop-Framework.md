# **GloopGlop Pathway to Worker-Ownership for Creators**

---

## **Purpose**
GloopGlop recognizes that creative labor, technical labor, and community labor are all valid and essential contributions to the success of the platform.

To honor this, GloopGlop provides a **clear pathway** for highly engaged community members and creators to become full **Worker-Owners**, earning equal pay, equal vote, and equal say in the future of the platform.

---

## **Eligibility Criteria**
To apply for Worker-Ownership as a creator or community participant:

- You must have earned Glops through normal platform participation (posting, watching, upvoting, supporting others).
- You must have **voluntarily donated** a minimum amount of Glops back to the Community Glop Pool (to support future Drops, rewards, and platform growth).
- You must have maintained **positive community standing** (no major moderation actions against your account).
- You must have been **an active participant** in GloopGlop for a minimum period (e.g., **6 months** — recommended).

---

## **Donation Threshold**
- The minimum Glop donation required to be eligible for application is set by Worker-Owner consensus.  
  (Example starting point: **5,000 Glops** donated.)

This amount can be adjusted over time by Worker-Owner vote based on platform growth and Glop economy changes.

---

## **Application Process**
1. Submit a **Worker-Owner Application Form** explaining:
   - Your contributions to GloopGlop.
   - Why you want to become a Worker-Owner.
   - Any areas you’d like to help improve/build in the future.
2. Your application is reviewed by existing Worker-Owners.
3. A democratic vote is held.
   - (Recommended: Approval requires **majority support** among current Worker-Owners.)
4. Upon approval:
   - You are officially admitted as a **Worker-Owner**.
   - You receive full **equal pay**, **equal voting rights**, and **equal governance rights** as any other worker.

---

## **Notes and Principles**
- **No Cash Buy-in:** Worker-Ownership is based solely on labor and community contribution, not financial investment.
- **Equal Ownership:** All Worker-Owners have one vote, one share, and equal governance rights.
- **Voluntary Path:** No user is ever required to become a Worker-Owner to continue participating in GloopGlop.
- **Ongoing Commitment:** Worker-Owners are expected to participate in governance meetings, platform improvement discussions, and act in the interest of the community.
