# **GloopGlop Worker-Owner Code of Conduct**

---

## **Purpose**

As Worker-Owners of GloopGlop, we are not just building a platform — we are building a community based on fairness, transparency, and mutual respect.

This Code of Conduct exists to ensure that all Worker-Owners uphold the values that GloopGlop stands for.

---

## **Core Principles**

- **Respect:** Treat every Worker-Owner, user, and partner with respect and dignity.
- **Transparency:** Communicate honestly and openly about work, decisions, and finances.
- **Integrity:** Act in the best interest of the platform and the community — not personal gain.
- **Participation:** Engage actively in governance, platform improvement, and community-building.
- **Responsibility:** Own your work. Follow through on commitments. Admit mistakes openly.
- **Fairness:** Support fair treatment for all users, workers, and community members — no favoritism, no discrimination.

---

## **Worker-Owner Responsibilities**

Every Worker-Owner agrees to:

- Attend governance meetings regularly (unless excused).
- Vote thoughtfully and fairly on platform matters.
- Use corporate resources responsibly and transparently.
- Help steward the Glop economy and Community Fund.
- Speak honestly about GloopGlop — celebrating successes and raising critiques respectfully.

---

## **Speaking and Acting Publicly**

- Worker-Owners are **free to talk about GloopGlop publicly** — sharing, promoting, or critiquing the platform openly.
- Worker-Owners **may personally advocate for GloopGlop** (e.g., promoting it to friends, posting about it, inviting others).
- **If speaking officially on behalf of GloopGlop** (e.g., negotiating partnerships, making formal press statements), Worker-Owners must seek prior consensus or approval from the Worker-Owner body.

(*In short: Be free, be honest, but don’t unilaterally negotiate deals or formal commitments without a group OK.*)

---

## **Prohibited Actions**

Worker-Owners must not:

- Abuse their position for personal financial gain.
- Misuse or steal from the Glop pool, Community Fund, or platform infrastructure.
- Engage in harassment, discrimination, or abusive behavior.
- Hide material information about platform decisions or finances.
- Make binding financial or legal agreements *on behalf* of GloopGlop without Worker-Owner approval.

---

## **Accountability and Removal**

If a Worker-Owner violates this Code of Conduct:

- Concerns can be raised by any Worker-Owner or verified user.
- The issue will be reviewed by all Worker-Owners.
- A democratic vote will be held on disciplinary action, including possible removal from Worker-Ownership.
- All removal votes must meet a defined majority (recommended: 2/3rds approval to remove).

---

## **Commitment to Growth**

We understand that no one is perfect.  
Worker-Owners are expected to learn, grow, and improve over time — not to be perfect from day one.

Mistakes are met with honesty and accountability, not shame or punishment.
