# **GloopGlop Transparency Policy**

## **Our Commitment to Transparency**

GloopGlop was founded on the principle that communities deserve honesty.  
We believe users and Worker-Owners have the right to see how resources are managed and how decisions are made.

Transparency isn’t optional — it’s core to who we are.

---

## **Financial Transparency**

- **All donations and platform funding** are handled through [OpenCollective.com](https://opencollective.com/how-it-works). [GloopGlop's Page](https://opencollective.com/gloopglop)
- **Monthly financial reports** will be posted publicly.
- **All spending decisions** related to worker payments, tech infrastructure, prize purchases, and platform improvements will be visible to the public.

---

## **Spending Priorities**

GloopGlop spending is focused on two key areas:
1. **Building and maintaining the platform** (hosting costs, development, security, tools, worker support).
2. **Funding Drops and user rewards** (purchasing prizes, sponsoring special events).

## **Glop Economy Transparency**

- **Glop Minting:**  
Glops are minted only when real value enters the platform (donations, revenue).
  
- **Glop Circulation:**  
The total supply of Glops and major distributions will be updated and published monthly.

- **Drop Sponsorships:**  
All external partner Drops (brand-sponsored prizes) will be clearly labeled.

---

## **Worker-Owner Accountability**

- Worker-Owners are elected through clear pathways based on contribution, not capital.
- Major governance decisions (new hires, tech shifts, rule changes) are subject to Worker-Owner votes.
- Worker-Owners are subject to community oversight, including potential removal if trust is broken.

---

## **No Hidden Deals**

- No secret bonuses.
- No off-the-books deals with brands or sponsors.
- No unreported revenue streams.

GloopGlop belongs to its workers and its community — always.
