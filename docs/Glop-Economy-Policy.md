# **GloopGlop: Glop Economy Policy**

---

## **1. What Are Glops?**

Glops are GloopGlop’s internal community points.  
They reward users and Worker-Owners for participating, supporting creators, and helping build the platform.

Glops can be spent on real-world rewards through Drops, gifted to other users, or donated back to the community to fund future rewards and growth.

---

## **2. How Are Glops Created?**

- **Initial Minting:**  
At launch, Glops are minted based on real cash donations to the GloopGlop Community Fund.  
1 dollar donated = 1 Glop minted.

- **Ongoing Minting:**  
As additional donations or revenue come in, new Glops may be minted at the same 1:1 rate.

- **No Free Minting:**  
Glops are only created when real value is added to the platform.  
There is no unlimited printing of Glops without real financial or community contribution.

---

## **3. How Are Glops Earned?**

Users and Worker-Owners can earn Glops by:
- Watching videos
- Posting content
- Upvoting or supporting other users
- Moderating and improving the community
- Completing special community challenges or projects

**Worker-Owners** additionally earn Glops when:
- They perform unpaid labor valued in cash (tracked for fairness)
- They choose to reinvest unspent corporate card allowances

---

## **4. How Are Glops Spent?**

Glops can be spent to:
- Enter Drops (raffles, giveaways, special rewards)
- Directly claim prizes listed at fixed Glop amounts
- Tip or gift Glops to other users and creators
- Donate Glops back to the Community Fund to stabilize the economy and support future Drops

---

## **5. Glop Redemption and Value Rules**

- **Glops cannot be cashed out for real money.**
- **Glops have no fixed resale value.**
- **Glops are purely for use within GloopGlop’s reward system.**

This protects GloopGlop from legal issues and ensures Glops remain a community-driven reward, not a speculative currency.

---

## **6. Managing the Glop Economy**

- GloopGlop will monitor Glop issuance and reward rates to avoid inflation and preserve value.
- If necessary, reward rates or Drop prices can be adjusted through Worker-Owner votes.
- Transparent monthly updates on the total Glop supply and Community Fund balance will be posted via Open Collective.

---

## **7. Donations and Glop Pool Growth**

- Donations from users, supporters, and sponsors are added to the GloopGlop Community Fund.
- New donations allow for more Glops to be minted and more prizes to be offered.
- All fund usage will be transparently reported to the public.

---

## **8. Philosophy of the Glop Economy**

GloopGlop’s economy is built on **real contribution, real rewards, and real transparency** — not speculation, artificial scarcity, or exploitation.

**We believe your time, creativity, and support deserve recognition and celebration.**
