# **GloopGlop Community Rules**

---

## **Welcome to GloopGlop!**

We’re building a better internet — one that values creativity, fairness, and community.  
To keep GloopGlop awesome for everyone, here are the basic rules we ask all users to follow.

---

#  
## **1. Respect Each Other**

- Treat everyone with kindness and respect.
- Harassment, hate speech, discrimination, threats, or bullying are not allowed — anywhere, ever.
- Disagree? Cool. Attack people? Not cool.

---

#  
## **2. Play Fair**

- Don't spam, scam, or mislead people.
- Don't try to game the Glop system unfairly (no bots, fake activity, or fraud).
- Don't upload content that you don’t have the rights to share.

---

#  
## **3. Keep It Legal**

- No illegal content.
- No promoting illegal activities.
- No uploading copyrighted material you don't own (no pirated shows, songs, etc.).

---

#  
## **4. Safe Spaces Matter**

- No sexual harassment.
- No doxxing (sharing private info without consent).
- No targeting or threatening vulnerable groups.

---

#  
## **5. About Glops**

- Glops are rewards for participating on GloopGlop.
- Glops have no real-world cash value and cannot be redeemed for cash.
- Glops are only for use inside GloopGlop (no selling or trading outside the platform).

---

#  
## **6. Drops and Rewards**

- All Drops (raffles, giveaways, prizes) will be run fairly and transparently.
- No purchase necessary to participate — just Glops earned through engagement.
- We reserve the right to adjust Drop rules to protect fairness if needed.

---

#  
## **7. Worker-Ownership and Governance**

- GloopGlop is a worker-owned cooperative.
- Worker-Owners make platform decisions democratically — not investors or outside corporations.
- Users can become Worker-Owners through contribution and commitment (see our [Pathway to Worker-Ownership](link-to-framework.md)).

---

#  
## **8. Enforcement**

- Breaking these rules may lead to removal of posts, loss of Glops, temporary bans, or permanent removal from GloopGlop — depending on the situation.
- Major issues (harassment, serious rule violations) will be reviewed by Worker-Owners and handled fairly.
- Appeals are allowed — we’re humans, not robots.

---

#  
## **9. Your Rights**

- You retain ownership of the original content you post (videos, art, music).
- By posting, you give GloopGlop permission to display your content inside the platform for others to enjoy.
