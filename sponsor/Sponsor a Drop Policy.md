# **GloopGlop Sponsor-a-Drop Policy**

---

## **Welcome!**

Thanks for your interest in sponsoring a Drop on GloopGlop!

GloopGlop is a worker-owned platform where users earn Glops through creativity, participation, and community support — and then spend Glops on real rewards, including sponsor Drops like yours.

We want to make sponsoring a Drop easy, transparent, and fair — for both our partners and our community.

#  
## **How Sponsoring a Drop Works**

- You (the sponsor) provide real-world rewards (examples: subscriptions, merch, tickets, gift cards).
- Users spend Glops to enter and claim your rewards.
- If a user wins, their Glops are **transferred** or **donated** to honor the Drop (depending on the agreement).
- If users don’t win, their Glops are refunded — or they can choose to donate them back to GloopGlop.

#  
## **Sponsor Requirements**

- **Rewards must be real, deliverable, and legal.**  
  (No scams, fake giveaways, or vaporware.)

- **Rewards must match their advertised value.**  
  (Example: a "free 6-month subscription" must actually last six months.)

- **Rewards must be fulfilled by the sponsor.**  
  (You’re responsible for delivering your own rewards — physical or digital.)

- **Rewards must not violate GloopGlop’s Community Rules.**  
  (No hate groups, no gambling products, no crypto projects, no scammy stuff.)

- **You cannot demand ownership, control, or special governance rights** in exchange for sponsorship.

#  
## **Transparency Rules**

- All sponsored Drops will be clearly labeled as "Sponsored by [Your Brand]" on GloopGlop.
- We will never hide or disguise sponsored rewards.
- Sponsorship donations do not buy decision-making power inside GloopGlop.

#  
## **Application and Approval Process**

1. Fill out the [Sponsor a Drop Application Form](link-to-form).
2. Our Worker-Owners review your submission.
3. If approved, we’ll help you set up your Drop listing and launch timeline.
4. If declined, we’ll respectfully explain why (and you're welcome to reapply later).

---

#  
## **Costs and Donations**

- Sponsoring a Drop does not require paying GloopGlop directly — you simply provide the rewards.
- However, donations to the GloopGlop Community Fund (on Open Collective) are always welcome if you want to help us grow!

---

#  
## **Our Right to Protect the Community**

GloopGlop reserves the right to reject or cancel a sponsored Drop if:
- The sponsor misrepresents the reward.
- The sponsor violates community trust or safety.
- The reward becomes impossible to fulfill.

(We will always act fairly and transparently in these cases.)
