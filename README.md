# **GloopGlop: How It Works**

---

### **[1] Join GloopGlop**  
- Make a free account.  
- Instantly start earning Glops just by using the platform.

---

### **[2] Earn Glops**
- **Watch videos** → earn Glops for every minute you watch.  
- **Post content** → earn Glops when others like or share your posts.  
- **Support creators** → earn bonus Glops for upvoting and participating in the community.

---

### **[3] Spend or Send Glops**
- **Enter Drops**: Use Glops to join raffles for real-world prizes — event tickets, art, gift cards, exclusive merch, and more!
- **Buy Stuff Directly**: Some prizes can be bought straight up with your Glops.
- **Transfer Glops**: Gift Glops to your friends, creators you love, or anyone who makes your day better.

---

### **[4] Worker Owners**
- **Workers = Owners**.  
- Everyone who helps build or run GloopGlop (developers, moderators, designers, etc.) is an equal owner.  
- **Ownership is flat** — 1 worker = 1 vote = 1 equal share.  
- **Salary**: Every worker is valued at $1000/hour for their work.  
- **Glops for Unpaid Work**: If we can’t pay full cash wages now, the difference is tracked as Glops — not equity, just credits to spend on rewards.

---

### **[5] Big Idea**
> "**GloopGlop isn't just another social platform.  
> It's a place where your time, creativity, and support actually get rewarded — not harvested for ads.**"

---

### **[6] (Optional) Believers: Donate, Don’t Dominate**
- GloopGlop is **worker-owned, forever** — no outside investors control it.  
- If you **believe** in what we’re building, you can **donate** to help fuel more prizes, better drops, and platform improvements.
- Donations are purely support — they **do not** buy ownership, votes, or special influence.
- Every dollar goes into growing GloopGlop *for the workers and community* — not for profit.

---

### **Founder’s Note**
> "**GloopGlop is being kickstarted with donations from our founders, both monetarily and through their labor — proof that we believe in building a better, fairer internet from day one.**"
