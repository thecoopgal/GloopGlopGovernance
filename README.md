*this presentation was originally generated by AI on April 9, 2025 and is reviewed and approved by humans

## Overview
Gloop Glop is a worker-owned, open-source platform that enables creators and developers to build community-driven digital products. Unlike traditional tech companies, Gloop Glop is structured as a cooperative where contributors are paid through a sustainable, tiered endowment model. This model guarantees financial security, democratic governance, and shared ownership.

## Mission
To build a socially responsible creator platform that fairly compensates contributors, enables community governance, and transforms open-source labor into lifelong financial security.

## The Endowment-Based Employment Model
Gloop Glop replaces traditional employment and startup equity models with a sustainable, tiered system where contributors build personal endowments that fund their salaries indefinitely. Once an endowment reaches a target value, the contributor becomes financially secure and may receive raises, benefits, and even full autonomy over their output.

### Tier Structure

#### Tier 0: Contributor
- Entry-level, freelance-style
- Paid in Glops or per project
- Optional path toward endowment building

#### Tier 1: Foundation
- Endowment Target: $1.67M
- Payout: $50,000/year (3% withdrawal)
- Entry-level employment

#### Tier 2: Builder
- Endowment Target: $2.67M
- Payout: $80,000/year
- Includes partial health coverage

#### Tier 3: Sustainer
- Endowment Target: $4.00M
- Payout: $120,000/year
- Full job security, basic benefits

#### Tier 4: Full Benefits
- Endowment Target: $6.00M
- Payout: $180,000/year
- Full healthcare, retirement, annual raises

#### Tier 5: Sovereign
- Endowment Target: $8.00M+
- Payout: $240,000+/year or full profit share
- Financial independence + full creative control

### Reap or Rise Mechanic
At each tier milestone, a contributor can choose to:
- **Reap**: Take surplus value as payouts
- **Rise**: Reinvest surplus into their endowment to reach the next tier

### Democratic Advancement
Tier promotions are not automatic. Once a contributor's endowment meets a tier threshold, their promotion is subject to a co-op vote. This ensures that advancement is based not only on economic output but also on community trust, alignment with co-op values, and collaboration.

## Executive Leadership
The co-op includes a fixed executive tier of 20 Tier 4 members, chosen through community election. These leaders coordinate major decisions and steward the platform's long-term vision.

## Example Allocation (Twitter-scale Revenue)
With $3 billion in annual revenue, Gloop Glop could sustain: [citation needed]
- 20 Tier 4 Executives
- 459 Tier 3 Sustainers
- 275 Tier 2 Builders
- 183 Tier 1 Foundation Members

Total: 937 fully-endowed cooperative workers

## Currency: Glops
Glops are the internal points-based currency of Gloop Glop, used for:
- Micro-compensation for contributions
- Voting power (for certain governance decisions)
- Access to platform perks and tools

## Revenue Model
- Ethical advertising
- Platform fees from premium tools
- Patronage and platform memberships
- Commissions on co-op created products

## Legal Structure
Gloop Glop is organized as a multi-stakeholder cooperative, prioritizing workers, contributors, and users equally. Open source contributions are licensed to maintain freedom while enabling commercialization.

## Conclusion
Gloop Glop proposes a bold new model for the digital economyâ€”one where contributors are owners, creators are secure, and the platform thrives through community collaboration. The endowment-based employment model aligns long-term security with productivity and values, offering a future of work worth building.
