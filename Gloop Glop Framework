Slide 2: The Problem with Traditional Models

Centralized ownership leads to unequal profit distribution

Contributors (creators, developers, designers) often work for free or low pay

Lack of community control & governance

Private investors can create conflicts of interest, prioritizing profits over contributors

Centralized ownership leads to unequal profit distribution

Contributors (creators, developers, designers) often work for free or low pay

Lack of community control & governance

Slide 3: The Cooperative Contribution Model

Everyone who contributes gets a stake in the projectâ€™s success

Contributions can include:

Content creation (videos, blogs, art, music)

Development work (coding, design, moderation)

Community engagement (hosting events, moderation, outreach)

Contributions are tracked using a points-based system

Slide 4: The Revenue-Sharing System

Instead of centralized profits, revenue is distributed among contributors

At the end of each cycle (quarterly, monthly), total revenue is divided among all points earned

Example:

Posting content = 100 points

Development contributions = variable points based on complexity

Community engagement (moderation, discussions) = points based on value

Donations = 100 points per $1

Slide 5: Applications of This Framework

Social Media & Content Platforms (like Gloop Glop)

Open-Source Software Development (collaborative coding projects)

Community-Owned Marketplaces (fair-trade digital or physical goods)

Creative Collectives (art, music, writing collaborations)

Slide 6: Open-Source & Community Contributions

All project work should be openly available for improvement

Governance should be transparent & democratic (community votes, proposals)

Development bounties can be issued for key tasks

Slide 7: Roadmap & Growth Plan

Phase 1: MVP (6 Months)

Define core features & setup open-source repository

Implement basic contribution tracking & reward system

Build an early community & test governance model

Phase 2: Expansion (6-12 Months)

Add more content types / project contributions

Improve discoverability & community tools

Strengthen revenue models (donations, ads, sponsorships)

Phase 3: Growth & Sustainability (12-24 Months)

Secure ethical funding sources

Expand governance structure (more decision-making tools)

Scale infrastructure to handle a larger user base

Slide 8: Why This Framework Matters

Shifts power & profits from corporations to contributors

Supports independent creators & open-source developers fairly

Encourages ethical, community-driven innovation

Slide 9: Get Involved!

Creators: Use this framework for your projects

Developers: Contribute to an open-source implementation

Organizations: Support cooperative development models
